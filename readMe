Node.js Installation
Node.js is a runtime environment that is required to run Cypress.

Windows, Mac, and Linux:
Download Node.js:

Visit the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/.
Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability, or the Current version for the latest features.
Install Node.js:

Run the installer you downloaded.
Follow the installation instructions, accepting the default settings.
Verify Installation:

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed:
bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm, indicating a successful installation.

Cypress Installation
Cypress is a testing framework for web applications that runs on top of Node.js.

Windows, Mac, and Linux:
Navigate to Your Project:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project's directory.
Install Cypress:

Run the following command to install Cypress as a development dependency in your project:
bash
Copy code
npm install cypress --save-dev
Initial Cypress Setup:

After installation, run the following command to initialize Cypress within your project:
bash
Copy code
npx cypress open
This command will create a cypress directory in your project and open the Cypress Test Runner.

Verifying the Installation
To ensure Node.js and Cypress were installed successfully, you can run the following commands in your terminal:

Node.js Version:

bash
Copy code
node -v
This command should return the installed Node.js version.

Cypress Version:

bash
Copy code
npx cypress -v
This command should return the installed Cypress version.

If you receive version numbers for both Node.js and Cypress, it means that both are installed on your system.

Getting Started
With Node.js and Cypress successfully installed, you're ready to start writing and running end-to-end tests for your web applications. You can create test files in the cypress/integration directory and use the Cypress Test Runner to execute your tests.

Refer to the official Cypress documentation for detailed information on writing and running tests.
